# Locktf: The Minimalist Approach to Productivity


Locktf is a single-page work assistant operating on the motto of "less is more."
The application, in a single-page minimalist approach and monochrome grayscale tonality, seeks to eliminate distractions and get you focused on what truly matters most: work. Although initially at a glance the application seems too minimalist, the feature has indeed been created not only to be powerful but user-friendly as well.
